# UserTrackAI

> This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of user behavior, product data, and session activity in an e-commerce environment.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how users interact with an online store by analyzing three main datasets:

- `user.csv` — demographic and basic info of users  
- `product.csv` — product metadata and category info  
- `session.csv` — user browsing and session activity  

The project includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn, folium)  
- Encoding and feature transformation  
- Geospatial analysis using `geopandas` and `folium`

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas**, **numpy**
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
- **geopandas**, **folium**

## 📍 Highlights

- Distribution and uniqueness of product, session, and user data  
- Detection of missing values and basic data imputation  
- Label encoding for categorical features  
- Initial steps toward segmentation and predictive modeling  
- Mapping user behavior geographically using Folium
